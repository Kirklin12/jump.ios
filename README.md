# Janrain iOS Mobile Libraries 5.5

This library provides a native iOS API to the Janrain user management platform's RESTful API endpoints.

iOS 8.x support has been deprecated. All code has been updated to support iOS 9.x and newer.

*NOTE:* Due to the large amount of code modifications required to address iOS 8.x deprecations it is important to test any integrations thoroughly.


**IMPORTANT**: Please read the Docs/Upgrade Guide.md and RELEASE_NOTES.

The library supports:

 * Authentication with social login (Janrain Engage)
 * Sign-in to, and user session management with, Janrain Capture
 * Social registration and traditional registration with Janrain Capture
 * Broadcast sharing via social login
